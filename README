This is what we have so far. We have embedded the code editor in a webpage. It can be accessed by logging in with your google
account. Currently, the program will make a text file from the code entered in the webpage, and commit it to our google svn.
However, running this on appengine will not work at the moment because of the inability to create files on appengine. 
Also, the push procedure was interrupted, but everything looks to be there so email me if you need me to repush the files.
